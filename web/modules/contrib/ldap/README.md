The current state of the LDAP module is still in-flux while the port to Drupal 8 is ongoing. The majority of the
core functionality is available and usable but caution should be taken for more complex scenarios such as provisioning
to LDAP.

Please see INSTALL.md for specific information on setting up the Drupal LDAP suite.

For more information review the following resources:

* [Project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/ldap)
* [Issue for Drupal 8 port](https://www.drupal.org/node/2259385)


## Module overview

| Module | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| ldap_authentication | This module provides a overall authentication functionality closely tied to ldap_user and ties in with several other modules, such as ldap_sso. |
| ldap_authorization | The module to grant roles to users based on directory criteria, relies on the externalauth module. |
| ldap_feeds (Unported) | Feeds integration to automatically sync users. |
| ldap_help | A debugging module to help you discover additional information through detailed logging.  |
| ldap_query | A module to allow you to execute custom queries, mostly useful for debugging. |
| ldap_servers | The base module for communicating with a directory. |
| ldap_sso | Provides Kerberos/NTLM single-sign-on. Note that this module is now a [separate project on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/ldap_sso). |
| ldap_user | A base module with low-level user functionality as well as mechanisms to sync user data. |
| ldap_views (Partially ported) | Views integration of LDAP. |

A common scenario for logging in users via LDAP, assigning groups to them and syncing user fields thus consists of
ldap_authentication, ldap_authorization, ldap_servers, ldap_user.

## Additional information

If you are not yet familiar with how LDAP operates or how directory services work in general, the following links can be
helpful resources. 

However, we recommend in any case that you contact your organization's directory maintainer, since
their help can often save you a significant amount of time in debugging.
